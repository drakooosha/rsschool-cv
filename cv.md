## Code example
**Array Deep Count**. Array.prototype.length will give you the number of top-level elements in an array.

Your task is to create a function deepCount that returns the number of ALL elements within an array, including any within inner-level arrays.
```
function deepCount(a) {
  return a.reduce(function deeper(count,arr){
    if(Array.isArray(arr)) {
      return count + deeper(arr);               
    } 
    else {
      return count;
    }
  }, a.length)
}
```
